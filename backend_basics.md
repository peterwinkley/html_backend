    -   [**HTTP**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)

        -   Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol which
            allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents.
            HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client
            opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until
            it receives a response.

    -   [**Postman**](https://www.getpostman.com/)

        -   Postman can be used to make HTTP
            [**Requests**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
            (e.g., a \"GET\" request for receiving information, or a
            \"POST\" request for submitting information to the database)
            and receive HTTP responses from outside of a traditional
            browser.

        -   There are three important parts of every **Response**
            received by Postman:

            -   \(1\) **Body**: Essentially the payload containing the
                HTML, CSS, and JS that you would see in \"View Page
                Source\").

            -   \(2\)
                [**Headers**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers):
                The metadata about the response (e.g., content-type,
                date, status).

            -   \(3\) [**Status
                Code**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status):
                Just a number indicating the status of the request
                (e.g., \"200\" means the request is OK, \"404\" means
                the content requested does not exist).

    -   [**Cloud9**](https://c9.io/)

        -   C9 is a complete developer environment that contains
            everything you need in the browser (e.g., a text editor,
            terminal, node.js, etc.).

        -   **NOTE**: This course\'s publicly visible Cloud9 workspace
            is available
            [here](https://ide.c9.io/learnwithcolt/webdevbootcamp).
